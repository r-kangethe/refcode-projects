# *WEEK 2 HOMEWORK*


## *HTML/BEST PRACTICES*

*Majority of practices mentioned in this article were covered in our first class.
However, there are some key things that are fairly important to always remember.
Such as using the correct doctype, closing tags, using the proper doc. structure
otherwise “documents will still work but not render correctly”, closing tags,
having a separate styling sheet, using lowercase markup(keep tag names in
lowercase that way it’s easier to read and maintain and remember to validate
frequently(this will lessen the amount of time when debugging).*

# *12 PRINCIPLES FOR A CLEAN HTML CODE*

*In this article, Chris Coyier- a web designer and developer- explains that a
“good CSS can only exist with an equally good HTML markup” and that the
foundation of a beautiful website is a beautiful HTML.
The article is similar to the above, both articles touch on the importance of
having a strict doctype, keeping CSS and Java Script external, keeping it
lowercase and leaving the typography to CSS to target a particular text,
running code through the validator machine to pick up small mistakes.
Unlike the other article, Chris reminds us of the importance of using proper
indentation and the huge effect it has on the readability of the code
even though it has no bearing on how the page is rendered.
Eliminate Unnecessary divs, have unique class and id names for the body.*

**I enjoyed reading this article, I will definitely re-visit it and read more
articles published by Chris.**



# *CSS Naming Conventions that Will Save You Hours of Debugging*

*I agree with Ohans statement that “a poorly written CSS will quickly turn into
a nightmare” So true!
He mentions the usage of Hyphen Delimited strings .
I’ve come across the usage of hyphens but not the delimited strings part.
He also mentions camel case, what is that? Is it the same thing with lower case?
Perhaps it’s because he is referring to Java Script.
**I don’t know the answer to this but will find out.**

*Ahh Hypens, about that, he reminds us to use hyphens and lower case ie
 .redBox (X) red-box(YES)  font-weight(Yes) fontWeight(X)*

*Moving along, he mentions BEM which stands for: BLOCK ELEMENTS MODIFIERS
So, what is it? It is a structured naming convention.
Some teams use hyphen delimiters while others prefer BEM.*

*He uses the “stickman” for his delimited strings examples*

*Block ( a blockbcould represent a header, footer or nav) and styled like eg.
 .stick-man {     }
Elements  ( in BEM naming, element class names are derived by adding
 two underscores followed by the element name)  ie.
. Stick-man__head {    }
 Modifiers ( using a red button or a blue button in the case of
 having either a blue or red stickman) Now in using the BEM,
 modifier class names are derived by adding two hyphens followed by the
 element name.
.stick-man--blue {    }
what about if you had stick man of different head sizes?
.stick-man reps. the Block
.stick-man__head  reps the element
.stick-man__head-- small {  }
.stick-man__head--big {   }*

# *Best Practices in CSS*

*Great article. This is a reminder of material previously learnt in
RefCode. For example, making CSS readable, utilization of Resets
(which honestly I never created), organizing the stylesheet.
The writer emphasizes the “avoidance of inline styling and having appropriate
naming conventions” just like previously read articles above. Above all,
I came across “combining CSS Elements”. I wonder if I ever used this? I thought
 it was clever.
For example h1, h2, h3 {font-family: Verdana; color: #elelel;}*

# *25 CSS best practices we follow at Innofied*

*When it comes to the Best practices to follow with CSS, this article by
Swarnendu De tops the others so far because it lists everything else mentioned
in the other articles and on top of it, it’s an easy read for me. Maybe its the
 styling and a clean page? Can’t pin point what it is. Overall,
 I loved the read. Something that I need to re-visit is the Block vs.
 Inline elements.  number 16 on the article.  **I will definitely revisit this article.**

# *Video*

*Layout and composition are the foundations of design. They give your work
structure and make it easier to navigate(from margins to content in between)
5 Basic principles.
Proximity- its about using visual space to show relationships in your content
( related items together) Text or visual.
White space- negative space between content, lines or outer margins.
Helps you define and separate different sections.
Alignment- consistent alignment, without it your work will start to
feel disorganized.
Contrast- create emphasis, call for something important( use color,
adjust size, shape or visual weight of object) is closely tied to Hierarchy
  which is a visual technique that can help the viewer navigate your work it
  shows the viewer where to begin and where to go next  using different levels
  of emphasis.  Decide which elements the reader to notice first and make them
  stand out by making elements (larger, bolder or more eye-catching in someway).
Repetition- every project should have a consistent look and feel.
(Such as color, header) Not for only aesthetic reasons,
 but it makes it easier to read and that lets the reader relax and
 focus on content.*


# *The Law of Similarity - Gestalt Principles*

*This article serves up a term that I have never encountered before, even though
 I come across Gestalt everyday.
So what is “Gestalt”?
It refers to a“shape” or “form” in German.
What are the Gestalt principles? **Gestalt principles** or laws are rules that
 describe how the human eye perceives visual elements and aim to show how
 complex scenes can be reduced to more simple shapes.
They aim to explain how the eyes perceive the shapes as a single, united form
 rather than the separate simpler elements involved.
 The following are Gestalts Principles(Similarity,
 Continuation,Closure,Proximity,Figure/Ground,Symmetry and order).
In this article they touch only on the Law of Similarity.
The article mentions that similarity is influenced by the shape, size and
color of elements and that in web and interactive design, the similarity
law can be used to contribute to building connections between linked elements
the relationship either being physical or conceptual and you can do this by
 helping your viewers eye discern parts of your design you want to accentuate.
So the writer states that, in order to draw a user’s attention you can use
(Links, Content and Headers) and let their brain do the rest.
The organization of cognitive processes(visual perception)-that Gestalt theorist
 and researchers attempt to understand- is important to our understanding
 of how we interpret the constant stream of visual information entering our
 eyes into a cohesive, meaningful and usable representation of the world.* 

# *The Building Blocks of Visual Design*

*This article is a combination of both the video and article materials.
When it comes to visual design, this article seems to concentrate on the
aesthetics on the other hand the previously watched video emphasizes on the
aesthetics and acknowledges that it’s also for the reader to relax and focus
on content.*
*This article mentions how Gestalt refers to our tendency to perceive
the “sum of all parts” as opposed to the individual elements thus the
reason that we can see a square, circle and triangle even though the
lines are not complete. To the point!*
**Re-read this article it has good stuff in it.**
